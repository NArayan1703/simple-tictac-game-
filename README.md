# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game board and buttons will be displayed on the page. Players can click on the empty cells to make their moves. The current player's mark will be displayed in the cell after each move. When the game is over (either a player wins or it's a tie), an alert message will inform the players of the result. Clicking the "Reset" button will clear the board and start a new game.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to make their moves.
3. The game ends when one player wins or if all cells are filled (tie).
4. An alert message will display the result, and you can click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
